# Elon Musk Tribute Page

Files added:
- `index.html` — the tribute page HTML
- `styles.css` — page styles
- `assets/` — placeholder folder for images (create this and add your photo as `elon.jpg`)

How to preview (Windows / PowerShell):

1. Open the folder in a browser: Right-click `index.html` and choose "Open with" → your browser, or run in PowerShell:

   Start-Process "index.html"

2. Replace the portrait image: create an `assets` folder next to `index.html` and add your photo named `elon.jpg`. The markup uses `assets/elon.jpg`.

Notes:
- The layout is responsive. For a higher-fidelity look use a large, high-contrast portrait image and tweak `--max-width` or font sizes in `styles.css`.
